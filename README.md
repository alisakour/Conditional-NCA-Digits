## Project Demo
Here is the model growing specific digits from a single pixel based on the class condition:

![Morphogenesis Demo](growth_of_digit_8)
*(Example: Growing digit '8' using conditional vectors)*

## Abstract
This repository contains the implementation of the paper **"Conditional Neural Cellular Automata for Class-Specific Morphogenesis of Handwritten Digits"**.
The model extends the original NCA framework to generate specific MNIST digits based on a conditional input vector.
